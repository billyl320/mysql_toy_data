    id: Unique identifier for each sample (auto-increments)
    sample_name: Name of the rock sample
    location: Location where the sample was collected
    rock_type: Type of rock (e.g., granite, basalt)
    mineral_composition: Description of the mineral composition
    date_collected: Date the sample was collected

### galaxies.sql

This code creates a table named "Galaxies" with these columns:

    name: Unique name for the galaxy (serves as the primary key)
    distance_mly: Distance to the galaxy in millions of light-years
    morphological_type: Morphological type of the galaxy (e.g., spiral, elliptical)

It then populates the table with data for the Andromeda Galaxy and our own Milky Way Galaxy.
